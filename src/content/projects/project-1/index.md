This is a long term work in progress. It's a platform using the AT Protocol for managing Bluesky social media posts, long form blog posts, and newsletter subscriptions.

It's testing my skills and forcing me to learn new things about distributed systems, concurrency, and cloud infrastructure.

Tech Stack: Nextjs and Tailwind for the front-end, Go for the backend, and Python for the machine learning implementation.
