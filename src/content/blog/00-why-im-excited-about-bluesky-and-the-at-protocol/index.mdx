## Introduction

Social media today often feels chaotic. Platforms bombard us with endless notifications, ads, and tactics to keep us scrolling, locking us in with no easy way out. Bluesky and the AT Protocol are trying to change that.

Think of Bluesky like email. With email, you can use any app—Gmail, Outlook—and still connect with everyone. The AT Protocol offers that same freedom for social media. Bluesky is one app using it, but others can be built too.

## My Experience with Bluesky

I started using Bluesky a week ago, tired of other platforms deciding what I see. Bluesky was different. Conversations felt like hanging out with friends instead of shouting into a crowd. I control how my feed works, and when I follow someone interesting, we have genuine back-and-forth discussions without competing for attention against viral posts, ads, bots, and reply guys.

What excites me most is the freedom. If a better Bluesky app comes along, I can switch to it while keeping all my followers and posts—taking my entire social media presence wherever I go.

## The AT Protocol: An Open Foundation

The AT Protocol works differently. Instead of one company controlling everything, it establishes a shared system any app can use—like the rules of the road. Everyone follows the same basics, but you choose which "car" (app) you want to drive.

### Why Openness Matters

An open approach puts users first. When protocols are open, companies compete by making better products instead of trapping users. Email is a perfect example—you don’t think twice about emailing someone on a different service because it’s open. The AT Protocol brings that same freedom to social media.

### Examples of Open Protocol Success

Protocols like SMTP (email), RSS (news feeds), and HTTP (web browsing) have connected people for decades without any one company controlling them. The AT Protocol builds on these ideas with modern tools for social media—moderation, account mobility, and flexibility for developers.

### Building on Open Standards

Open platforms allow developers to create without seeking permission. This is why the AT Protocol excites creators—they can build apps and tools freely, without waiting for approval or concerns about platform specific risks.

## The Importance of Developer Freedom

Recent events have shown why this matters. [Twitter raised their API prices to $42,000 per month](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/), forcing many apps to shut down. [Reddit did something similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). Developers lost years of work, and users lost favorite tools. The AT Protocol prevents this by keeping access open and sustainable.

## User Choice and Innovation

This freedom gives users more choices for using social media. Want an app that focuses only on photo posts? Or one combining Bluesky with other feeds? Developers can create these without fear of shutdown.

If someone makes a better way to share photos, everyone benefits—like how all browsers added tabs once one proved their usefulness. When good ideas spread freely, everyone wins.

## A Better User Experience

Bluesky lets you control your feed, like tuning into different radio stations. It’s different from platforms like Facebook and Twitter, where algorithms keep you scrolling with emotional, often negative content to drive ad revenue.

### Bluesky's Approach to Feeds

[Bluesky's default feed doesn’t push viral or outrage content](https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds). You can switch between feeds—some show only photo posts, others focus on specific topics.

As of this writing, I have several feeds dedicated to topics I'm interested in - [Build in Public](https://bsky.app/profile/dustinturner.io/feed/buildinpublic), [Machine Learning](https://bsky.app/profile/alexr.bsky.social/feed/MLSky), [Academia](https://bsky.app/profile/markrubin.bsky.social/feed/aaak6p5s2f3cu).

### Custom Feeds and User Behavior

These simple, understandable feeds change user behavior. Without posts competing for attention, people share more authentic thoughts and have richer discussions. Custom feeds let you follow specific topics instead of whatever an algorithm decides is trending.

## Making Real Connections

Most social media feels lonely despite thousands of followers because it’s designed for broadcasting, not conversation. Bluesky is different—it's built around real conversations. I find myself in meaningful back-and-forth discussions rather than chasing likes.

I'm not worried about crafting a compelling hook or writing in a certain cadence to satisfy copywriting trends that capture attention.

I'm not trying to set a daily schedule to reply to 50 large accounts to have my comments seen or to prove to the algorithim I'm consistently engaging.

I post when I have something to say, not because I think it will get a lot of engagement. And people respond when they want to contribute to the discourse.

### Community Building on Bluesky

Communities on Bluesky remind me of the early internet—smaller, human-sized groups forming around shared interests. Seeing familiar names in discussions builds trust, leading to real friendships rather than algorithm-driven interactions. People introduce newcomers, create thoughtful feeds, and organize events, fostering genuine community spirit.

## Learning From the Past to Build Better Communities

Social media's evolution teaches us valuable lessons. Platforms started with genuine connections but changed as engagement metrics took over, rewarding content designed to go viral. Bluesky aims to break this cycle by letting users decide what’s valuable, avoiding the pitfalls of past platforms.

For creators, this means shifting focus from follower counts to the depth and quality of conversations, real relationships, and sustainable content creation that doesn't lead to burnout.

## Looking Forward

Bluesky's growth tells an interesting story. While it started with a small group of tech enthusiasts, it’s attracting people tired of traditional social media’s problems. Growth brings challenges, but the AT Protocol's open nature allows communities to grow naturally while retaining their character—like neighborhoods in a city.

### Opportunities for Developers

Growth means more opportunities for developers to build tools addressing specific needs—group discussions, culture maintenance, or improved moderation. The protocol’s openness means developers can experiment freely, without fear of being shut down or priced out.

### Addressing Technical Challenges

Challenges like handling more users, managing content discovery, and moderation exist. But Bluesky’s community-driven approach allows solutions to come from everywhere, benefiting all users of the AT Protocol.

## The Path Ahead

The next year will be crucial. Bluesky’s success doesn’t depend on becoming the biggest or most profitable—it’s about providing a space for meaningful connections and conversations.

## Closing Thoughts

Social media has evolved from spaces for connection to attention-driven engines. Engagement metrics have changed how we think about relationships. Bluesky offers something different—its open protocol, customizable feeds, and conversation-first design encourage real connections.

As early users, we help shape Bluesky’s future. Instead of replicating the problems of other platforms, we can focus on genuine conversations, shared learning, and meaningful connections. Bluesky doesn’t need to be the biggest—it just needs to be the place where human connections thrive, built together, one real conversation at a time.
