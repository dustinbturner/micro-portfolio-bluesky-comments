## A Front Row Seat to Social Media's Evolution

I was a freshman in college when Facebook first launched in 2004. Like many others from that era, I had a front row seat to watch social media transform from a simple way to connect with classmates into something that fundamentally altered how society interacts.

Twenty years later, the landscape is unrecognizable.

I got rid of Facebook in 2013, probably a good sign that social media wasn't an enjoyable place even back then. Instagram lasted a bit longer, but mostly for sharing memes with friends.

The 2020 presidential election was the final straw there.

## The Cyberpunk Hellscape of Modern Social Media

Twitter never clicked for me.

It felt like walking into this dystopian, cyberpunk hellscape ‚Äì very Altered Carbon feeling.

Bombarded by ads from every direction, copywriting frameworks that made every post look identical, trending topics dominated by whatever jackass politician decided they wanted the spotlight that day.

I would get fleeting moments of motivation thinking I was going to go all in, deal with the miserable experience, and make something out of 'building a brand'.

But, that never happened. I signed up and deactivated my account more times than I can count.

I kept tabs on the new platforms that emerged. Mastodon, Threads ‚Äì each promising something different, but ultimately falling into familiar patterns.

None of them felt like a genuine alternative to the algorithm-driven chaos they were trying to replace.

Tik Tok is in another category. Fortunately, I've never felt the urge to sign up. I don't see that changing anytime soon.

## Finding a Different Path on Bluesky

Bluesky is different. In just a week of being here, I've noticed a significant shift in both my mood and motivation.

Not just to tackle a challenging SaaS build and work toward leaving corporate America, but actual enthusiasm about building a community of thoughtful, engaging, like-minded people.

I signed up just as many of the familiar faces from Twitter were making the transition. What happened next was remarkable ‚Äì it seemed like we all embraced this unwritten understanding that this space would be a different kind of space.

Sure, there's still engagement-focused content like starter packs and lists.

But it's like we all recognized how exhausting and toxic the bird app was, and we're all hell bent on making sure that doesn't happen here.

## Beyond Monetary Goals

Yes, you'll still find people sharing MRR screenshots, but most recognize we're all running our own race. It's motivating and those milestones absolutely deserve to be celebrated - people worked hard as hell to get there.

But, beyond like $20-30k MRR, there isn't a lot of value for the community to see those numbers month after month.

$100k MRR isn't my goal. To be honest, I don't have a monetary goal.

What I want is autonomy and the ability to work on projects I deem meaningful. This post by [asmartbear.com](https://bsky.app/profile/asmartbear.com) really resonated with me:

<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2b2lqipf3vklnfslluzsqiso/app.bsky.feed.post/3lbq5bebk3i2f" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihpjvzxwj5nf7wxqt2qqifyf47we3wqin3kgeyabmgqohnehpu354">
  <p lang="en-US">
    Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking the word &quot;autonomy&quot; is better than &quot;freedom,&quot; because you&#x27;re not really free ‚Äî you have support tickets to answer, bugs to fix, customers to placate, employees to excite, and so on.

    Do you agree?

  </p>

I want to be able to solicit candid feedback from others and be the kind of person people seek out for honest insights.

That's why I'm starting this newsletter.

The goal isn't to build an email list so I can force-feed ads, products, and promotions.

Instead, I want to capture the ups and downs, lessons learned, and insights as I build bluesletter.social.

More importantly, I hope to help foster an awesome indie hacker community within the Bluesky / AT Protocol ecosystem.

## Building Something Meaningful Together

This feels like the beginning of something genuinely different. If you're interested in building beyond the algorithm ‚Äì in creating something meaningful without chasing metrics or following formulas ‚Äì I invite you to join me on this journey.

Let's see what we can build together.

## What to Expect Every Monday

The newsletter launches ~~next Monday - December 2nd~~ Monday, December 9th. **_Corrected the date._**

Each week, I'll share insights and observations as I build in public, focusing on three key areas that I believe are crucial for creators and builders in this new space:

### 1. Navigating the Post-Algorithm World

We'll explore the evolving landscape of content creation for indie hackers. Not the usual "how I got to $10k MRR" posts, but thoughtful discussions about building sustainable, meaningful projects in a "post-algorithm" world.

What does it mean to create value when you're not optimizing for engagement metrics?

How do we measure success when we're prioritizing impact over impressions?

These are the questions we'll tackle together.

### 2. Understanding the Technology

I'll break down the technical side of Bluesky's ecosystem and the AT Protocol.

As I build bluesletter.social, I'm diving deep into these technologies, learning their quirks and capabilities. Rather than keeping this knowledge to myself, I'll share detailed tutorials and insights that help you understand not just the how, but the why behind these tools.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, I think you'll find practical value in understanding this new protocol.

### 3. Leveraging AI Thoughtfully

I'm fascinated by the role of AI in this new era of creation.

We're at an interesting inflection point where AI tools can either enhance our creativity or replace human judgment entirely.

Each week, I'll share transparent case studies from my own experience using AI tools in building bluesletter.social.

Like this:

    Try this with Claude.

    You can create a 'Project' and upload files for it, shadcn component files in this case, and ask that it strictly use those to build whatever component/dashboard/etc.

    Be thorough in the context you give it and the results are pretty solid.

</blockquote>

You'll see exactly how I'm using these tools to work smarter while maintaining authenticity and human creativity at the core of everything I build.

## Join the Journey

This isn't just another newsletter cluttering your inbox.

It's a weekly conversation about building something meaningful in a space that finally feels ready for genuine connection and creativity.

If you're tired of the growth-hacking playbook and ready to build something that matters, join me every Monday morning for a fresh perspective on what's possible when we build beyond the algorithm.
